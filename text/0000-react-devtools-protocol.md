# Summary

Introduce a standardized "React Devtools Protocol" that exposes structured, production-friendly observability and profiling data directly from React’s internals, enabling third-party tools to monitor and diagnose performance at scale.

# Basic example

idk yet

# Motivation

Current React debugging and profiling tools, while excellent for development, lack first-class support for deep, production-level insights. Third-party solutions resort to internal APIs or unsupported hooks, causing fragility as React evolves. A stable protocol would:

- Provide real-time, structured insights into component render costs and state transitions.
- Support production observability use cases without relying on undocumented internals.
- Encourage a richer ecosystem of performance and diagnostic tools, all aligned with React’s roadmap.

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with React to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# Drawbacks

- Additional complexity in the React codebase to maintain a stable protocol.
- Potential learning curve for developers integrating with or relying on these new capabilities.
- Extra surface area for API versioning and compatibility concerns.

# Alternatives

- Continuing to rely on React DevTools’ unofficial internals.
- Patching React at runtime, which is fragile and discouraged.
- Manually instrumenting components, which doesn’t scale and requires code changes.

# Adoption strategy

The protocol could start as an experimental API behind a feature flag. Early adopters (e.g., performance monitoring tools) would provide feedback before a stable release. This should not be a breaking change; existing apps would remain unaffected unless they opt in.

# How we teach this

Documentation would introduce the protocol as an optional layer for advanced tooling. Guides can show how to integrate with the protocol to gather performance data, using simple code snippets and comparisons with existing devtools workflows. The protocol would be framed as a natural extension for power users and ecosystem tools, not a required feature for general app development.

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
